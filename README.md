1. Naming convention for all filenames, paths, and folders.
- The naming conventions for all filenames should be lowercase, no spaces and dashes are fine. Folder naming conventions should be similar to file names. For paths, the folders, assets, and files should be inside the root folder so they can be easily linked to any .html files.

2. Best practices for commit messages
- The best practices for commit messages are having a minimum of 3 words and 10 characters, proper spelling and grammar, capitalize first letter and no periods, must start with verbs like create or fix, and lastly pretend every commit starts with "This commit will...".

3. What is HTML?
- HTML stands for hypertext markup language which is the coding language that's used to describe the content of websites.


4. Proper syntax for HTML tags
- Proper syntax for html tags should be an open tag with a tag name inside then write the element content and then finish with a closing tag with the same tag name.

5. Explain or demonstrate commonly used html tags/elements:
headings: h1-h6
- h1-h6 are heading tags h1 is considered the most important of the webpage therefore h6 is considered the least important and smallest of the webpage.
For example, h1-h6 would be written like:
    <h1>example content</h1>

p
- This element defines a paragraph of text and is considered a block-level element. This element also always starts on a new line.
For example, p would be written like:
    <p>paragraph content</p>

lists: ul, ol, dl
- ul is an unordered list, ol is an ordered list, and dl is a description list.
For example, ul, ol, and dl would be written like:
    <ul>content</ul>    <ol>content</ol>    <dl>content</dl>
